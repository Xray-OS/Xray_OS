# Ada
Formerly Xray_OS This is my own personal and customized Arch-based Linux instance nobody asked for, this ISO contains all of my personal settings and packages, that I normally use by default in Linux.

Currently is mostly a project for my personal use, but I share it publicly though.

## Nvidia-Drivers or AMD-Drivers
In case of AMD, Linux already has native excellent support with AMD cards. When it comes to NVIDIA drivers the support is excellent, mostly all essential processes NVIDIA drivers requires are well implemented also.

## General Essential Tweaks to improve the experience in Linux
Little tweaks like support for things like switcheroo-control, supergfxctl, better performance for NVME or SSD drives, Bluetooth, Flatpak, KDE-Plasma preconfigured nicely, CHAOTIC-AUR integraded already, all necessary programs and apps, some custom repositories, improvements to the shell and several terminals settings.

## Conclusion
Like I said at the beginning, this is my personal Linux OS instance, for sure this can get better than what it currently is if people like it and support it, other than that.. is just a matter of time till it dies.
